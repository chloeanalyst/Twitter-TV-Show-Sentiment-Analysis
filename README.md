# Twitter-TV-Show-Sentiment-Analysis

### Project Overview

This project started out as from a small Google Sheets exploration piece using third party tools around 2/3 years ago. 
The project quickly outgrew Google Sheets and I began to learn R to scale up the analysis. 
The script started with a basic sentiment methdology using a list of positive and negative words defined by myself. 
Each year I make some tweaks to the code to enhance performance and analysis methodology through lots of tears, dead end google searches and trying lots of stakoverflow solutions. 
I feel that the sciript is now at a point where it is useful for others, please feel free to fork, use for your projects and improve.
I have some ideas for future iterations of this script and intend to dig deeper into sentiment methodology throughout the year.
